# Camtrip

An android camera app made with capacitor, vite and React.js (not React Native).
Those technologies were chosen to be easier for a front-end developer to also develop apps.

## WIP

This app is under development!

## What is Working?

- Front Camera
- Back Camera (Main)
- Mirror
- Mute
- Filter: Gray-scale

## TODO

- [x] Make camera preview
- [x] Toggle camera source front/back
- [x] Toggle audio on/off
- [x] Find a way to add filters
- [ ] Create settings menu for filters
- [ ] Create settings menu for quality (Resolution, FPS, Bitrate)
- [ ] Move items to its respective menu
- [ ] Discover how to cast the camera image over the network
- [ ] Test Camtrip as a camera or browser source in OBS
- [ ] Find a way to centralize camera according to face position
- [ ] Maybe add option to take pictures and make recordings and save inside the phone
